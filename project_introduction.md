## Problem Situation
- **Stakeholders:** United States citizens all have a stake in the gun control debate and demand the truth behind gun violence. Gun lobbyists and activist groups like the National Rifle Association use money and political power to influence how gun violence is perceived.
- **Problem Setting:** The Current United States of America and its sates each represent a variation of the problem.
- **Values and Tensions:** The United States Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms yet many are questioning if high gun violence is worth that freedom.
- **Policy and ethic elements:** Race and age have a major impact on every persons' socioeconomic level and the society they surround themselves with. Guns may have a greater impact on certain races and ages in different ways.
