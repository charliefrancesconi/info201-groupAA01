## 1.0 Introduction

#### 1.1 Problem Situation
- **Stakeholders:** United States citizens all have a stake in the gun control debate and demand the truth behind gun violence. Gun lobbyists and activist groups like the National Rifle Association use money and political power to influence how gun violence is perceived.
- **Problem Setting:** The Current United States of America and its sates each represent a variation of the problem.
- **Values and Tensions:** The United States Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms yet many are questioning if high gun violence is worth that freedom.
- **Policy and ethic elements:** Each state in the US has its own variation of gun ownership laws and policies. Changes from state to state may effect gun violence.


#### 1.2 What is the problem?
- In 1996 the NRA pushed for an act of congress named the Dickey Amendment. This amendment effectively stifled major CDC gun injury research and data collection. (_Source_: NPR)[1] Data and research into gun violence is limited. This keeps US citizens unaware of the true effects the right to bear arms has on their country. More importantly US citizens are unaware of who is impacted by gun violence in their state and how.

#### 1.3 What does it matter?
- As of 2017 there are more guns than people in the United States.(_Source_: The Washington Post)[2] If weapons are this prevalent in the US the facts need to be available. When facts are kept from the conversation effective change cannot advance. It is important that we can examine and appreciate all aspects of gun violence in the US to address this issue.

#### 1.4 How it will be addressed?
- We will recognize those impacted by gun violence and showcase who is impacted most, how they are impacted, and where in the US gun violence takes root. Focusing on causes, the people effected, and the states where violence occurred will allow us to paint a better national and regional portrait of the cold facts behind the gun control debate in America.

## 2.0 Research Questions
1. What states have the highest rate of gun violence and what racial/gender groups are effected?
2. What categories of gun violence are most prevalent by state?

## 3.0 Possible data sets
1. Five Thirty Eight's _Gun Deaths In America_ data set provides an in depth look into gender, race, and causes of gun deaths in the US. It includes 100,800 observations and 10 attributes. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/ (_Source_: Five Thirty Eight)
2. _Gun Violence Data_ on Kaggle includes more than 260k incidents and the US state they occured in. It includes 263,653 observations and 29 attributes.  https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data (_Source_: Kaggle)

## 4.0 Info visualizations
Info visualizations are essential to analyze huge amounts of data by enabling us to easily identify key data trends. Thus, it will reveal patterns, conditions, and correlations for different aspects of the data. The two figures below (Figure 1. & Figure 2.), visualizes the shooting occurrences in a map. Both aforementioned figures help us understand where shootings occurred and measure how deadly the shootings were.

_Figure 1._ This graphic shows the locations of mass shooting incidents and their quick info. In our project, we propose to create a similar information visualization and allow users to explore the density and detail of gun violence incidents. (Source: Mother Jones) [3]

_Figure 2._ This graphic shows a histogram of the U.S gun deaths by year from 2012 to 2016. In our project, we decided to use such visualizations to more accurately present our data details. (Source: Daniel Nass) [4]

## 5.0 Team Coordination
##### (a) Weekly times:
- Mon, Wed, Fri ( 4:30 ~ 6 :00 pm) @ Suzzallo library

##### (b) Individual goal(s) & role(s):
- April Lee : Introduction, Research question, Team coordination
 + Goal :  I know how to identify problems and analyze the situation based on the datasets, and predict potential problems with possible solutions. I will further
- Charlie Francesconi : Topic, Introduction, Markdown document creator, Team leader, and primary english speaker.
 + Goal : Put together an analysis of gun violence data that will provide some insight into gun violence by state. I also want to learn more about the issues we are examining in the data.
- Alan Zheng : Possible data sets, Information visualization, Team +      coordination
 + Goal : To use different types of visualization to present accurate data. Showing others an easier way to understand data.
- Bryan Bernardi : Possible data sets, Information visualization, Team coordination
 + Goal : To hone my data analysis skills to identify current issues, gather and organize data, then predict and solve future problems. My bigger goal is to effectively implement data science to better this world.

##### (c) Communication:
- Whatsapp: good for communicating across multiple international/US numbers.

##### (d).Feedback & Managing conflicts:
- We will work together if one of our team members confront difficulties by explaining what is going on and work through as a team and check if he/she understands well.

## 6.0 Questions for Teaching Team
1. Are/should we have data sets that are more different so we can analyze trends between the two?
2. How do we know if a data set is usable or free or copyrighted?
