# Project Background Information
### What is the problem?
- In 1996 the NRA pushed for an act of congress named the Dickey Amendment. This amendment effectively stifled major CDC gun injury research and data collection. (_Source_: NPR)[1] Data and research into gun violence is limited. This keeps US citizens unaware of the true effects the right to bear arms has on their country. More importantly US citizens are unaware of who is impacted by gun violence in their state and how.

### What does it matter?
- As of 2017 there are more guns than people in the United States.(_Source_: The Washington Post)[2] If weapons are this prevalent in the US the facts need to be available. When facts are kept from the conversation effective change cannot advance. It is important that we can examine and appreciate all aspects of gun violence in the US to address this issue.

### How it will be addressed?
- We will recognize those impacted by gun violence by showcasing which races and ages are impacted most and what the intention is of gun violence within these groups. Focusing on causes and the people effected better national portrait of the cold facts behind the gun control debate in America.

### Research Questions:
1. What races are most impacted by gun violence and of these races, what is the intent of the gun violence impacting them?
2. At what age are people most killed by what intentions of gun violence?
