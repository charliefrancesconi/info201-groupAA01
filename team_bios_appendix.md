## Appendix 2: Use of Envisioning Cards
Envisioning Cards were used periodically through the project to allow our group to take a step back and fully comprehend our work through a moral and ethical lens.

## Team Bios/Reflections:
- **April Lee:** Working on my visualization was difficult. It was not difficult because of the coding, I had that down already from A5. What was especially difficult was understanding how my visualization effects the research questions. When I started making the visualization I thought I would just be creating another way for someone to be able to see the csv in a creative way. What I quickly realized was that the visualization needed to highlight a trend or pattern easily to the viewer that could answer the question. To do this I reviewed the effective visualizations chapter in the text book and used their suggestions to build my visualizations. Although it was a challenge at first, I am glad that my visualizations have a true purpose behind them besides a prettier way to see the data outside of a csv file. Working on this part of the project definitely increased my skills as a coder but surprisingly also as a thinker.

- **Charlie Francesconi:** One thing I learned from this assignment is learning how to work with my team better and how to divide up work accordingly. When I was working on the technical report I didn't realize how much I was going to need to ask my teammates about what they had done and it make a relatively simple process rather difficult. In the future I will make sure to read the whole specification and make sure I understand it before just diving in and making roles and responsibilities for my team. Even though this was difficult I think it all worked out in the end and I am very glad I learned now from it. This developed my identity as a thinker and innovator because now I know to plan as a thinker and work though my writing like an innovator. One more thing I need to mention is I need to get much better at using github because I keep pushing the wrong versions of files and I do not think LFS is working for me.

- **Bryan Bernardi:** Creating the shiny app was most frustrating for me. Working on a brand new topic we have never worked with before in an assignment was incredibly difficult because it was a brand new topic for me as a coder. Each step presented new challenges in coding. The biggest challenge was importing all of my teammates work into the one application. This was because they needed to create their visualization or modify a data set and then push it to github for me to try and work with in the shiny app and see if I could create a slider or panel based on what they created. This was a major challenge especially when my teammates work wasn't immediately working with the app. Nevertheless I am excited to have taken on this challenge. Working with my teammates code allowed me to push myself fully into shiny development and I believe I am a much stronger coder because of it.

- **Zhijian Zheng:** I really enjoyed working with the data sets in the beginning. The amount of observations and features made it easy to come up with research questions and ideas for potential visualizations. Little did I realize how much time I would need to spend cleaning the data. All over the place in the datasets there were missing values and problems with null or weird data entries. What helped most at this point in the process was consulting my team and seeing what they needed from the data. This allowed me to narrow my focus of what I needed to clean out of the data instead of just simply saying "I'm going to clean the data" with no real purpose. Consulting my team also helped me get tips on how to go about dividing the data and looking at what was relevant. Overall I liked this task, even with its challenges, because it has made me a better communicator with my team and more effective as a team-member with my code.
